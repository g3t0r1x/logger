Logger class features:
* overloaded operator<< so it ca be used as a standard ostream object,
* there are some main severities added such as: info, warning, error etc,
* coloring per severity added for both windows and linux OS,
* error severity logs are forwarded to std::cerr stream,
* after end of each message end line character is added automatically,
* debug severity is printed once additional CXX_FLAG of DBG_ENABLED is provided; else such logs will be ignored,
* one argument needs to be provided upon constructing this class, which I recommend to set as calling client name.


Example of use:
class A
{
public:
    A();

    do_sth(int i)
    {
        if (i > 5)
        {
            logger_ << info << i << " is greater than 5.";
            return;
        }
        logger_ << warning << i << " is less of equal than 5";
    }

private:
    Logger logger_{"A"};
}
